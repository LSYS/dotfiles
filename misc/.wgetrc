## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
##
# Quota. A value optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes). (Default is inf.)
quota = inf

# Times to retry when a download fails. (The default is 20.)
tries = 20

# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
waitretry = 10

##
## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
##
## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
## are doing before doing so.
##

# Use the server-provided last modification date, if available. (Default is off.)
timestamping = on

# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
# the default!
robots = off

# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
wait = 0

# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
recursive = off

# Turn on to prevent following non-HTTPS links when in recursive mode
httpsonly = on

# Do not go up in the directory structure when downloading recursively
no_parent = on

# Wait 60 seconds before timing out. This applies to all timeouts: DNS, connect and read. (The default read timeout is 15 minutes!)
timeout = 60

# Retry even when the connection was refused
retry_connrefused = on

# Use the last component of a redirection URL for the local file name
trust_server_names = on

# Have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default. (Default is off.)
follow_ftp = on

# Add a `.html` extension to `text/html` or `application/xhtml+xml` files that lack one, or a `.css` extension to `text/css` files that lack one
