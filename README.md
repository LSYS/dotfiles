# .files for Windows + WSL

## My key concerns/needs

* Bash should be properly set up with prompts (via `Oh-My-Posh`)
* Install using package managers whenever possible (`apt`, `brew`, `winget`, `choco`, `npm`)
* (Mini)Conda, Jupyter, Python
* LaTeX + reveal-md for typesetting
* Main assests (dotfiles, bin/, etc.) are symlinked from this repo into `$HOME`

## Installation 

## Additional Details

### Bash

* `.exports`: for Environment variables (e.g., custom shell utilities and `conda` is specified here)

Will be installed in ???

`.bash_profile` is the first config that will be read by `bash`. So this file will source all other relevant dotfiles.

    <li>Using his way of using a `.functions` for shell scripts too complex for an alias (for `.bash_aliases`) but too small for stand-alone scripts (like in `bin/`). (This is of course a judgement call.)
